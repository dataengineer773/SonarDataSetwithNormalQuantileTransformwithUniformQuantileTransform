 I will the Soanr dataset , it involve 60 real-valued inputs and two-class target variable at first we load and then we evaluate with knn and get accuracy in the next step we use Normal Quantile Transform
 it is often desirable to ttransform an input variable to have  a normal probability distribution to improve the modeling perormnace, class and set the output_distribution argument to noemal , we must also set the
 the n_quantile argument to a value less thanthe number of observation in the training dataset, in this case 100, we can call fit_transform() function and pass it to our dataset to create a quantile transformed
 and then evaluate with knn and get accuracy.in the next step we use Uniform Quantile Transform, sometimes it can be beneficial to transform a highly exponantial or multi-model distribution to have a uniform 
 distribution and then evaluate with knn and get accuracy , we see accuracy in the 3 step is bets and highest abd has a good accuracy performance and in the final step we choose the number of quantile as an arbitrary
 number in this case ,100, this hyperparameter can be tunned to explore the effect of the resolution of the transform on the resulting skill of the model
